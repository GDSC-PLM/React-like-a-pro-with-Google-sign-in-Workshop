A two-day study jam for students that are interested to learn how they can implement Google Authentication on their React Applications and learn everything they need to know about the Flutter framework.


### About the event
On the 19th of March 2023, the study jam will be a code-along and is divided into two parts. The first part, led by Dzelle Tan, focuses on the basics of the ReactJS framework to give the audience a brief background of the framework and boost their interest to further learn about it. The second part, led by Andre Villanueva, is all about the core of the study jam, which is learning how to implement Google Authentication on React Web Applications.
